    problem1(nums::Vector{Int}, trgt::Int)

Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two
numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not
use the same element twice.

Constraints:

* 2 <= nums.length <= 10^3
* ``-10^9`` <= nums[i] <= ``10^9``
* ``-10^9`` <= target <= ``10^9``
* Only one valid answer exists.

    problem7a(x::Int64)

Given a signed 32-bit integer ``x``, return ``x`` with its digits reversed. If reversing
``x`` causes the value to go outside the signed 32-bit integer range ``[-2^{31}, 2^{31} -
1]``, then return 0.

a-variant is solution with integer arithmetics.

    problem9(x::Int)

Given an integer x, return true if x is palindrome integer.

An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward. For
example, 121 is palindrome while 123 is not.

```jldoctests

Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: ``I, V, X, L, C, D``
and ``M``.

| Symbol | Value
|--------|--------
|  I     |   1
|  V     |   5
|  X     |   10
|  L     |   50
|  C     |   100
|  D     |   500
|  M     |   1000


For example, 2 is written as ``II`` in Roman numeral, just two one's added
together. 12 is written as ``XII``, which is simply ``X + II``. The number 27 is
written as ``XXVII``, which is ``XX + V + II``.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right.
However, the numeral for four is not ``IIII``. Instead, the number four is written
as ``IV``. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same
principle applies to the number nine, which is written as ``IX``. There are six
instances where subtraction is used:

* ``I`` can be placed before ``V`` (5) and ``X`` (10) to make 4 and 9. 
* ``X`` can be placed before``L`` (50) and ``C`` (100) to make 40 and 90. 
* ``C`` can be placed before ``D`` (500) and ``M`` (1000) to make 400 and 900. 

Given an integer, convert it to a roman numeral.
